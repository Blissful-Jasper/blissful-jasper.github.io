## ABOUT ME

I am a PhD student in the Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Hohai University, focusing on tropical atmospheric dynamics. My research interests include convectively coupled equatorial waves, tropical precipitation variability, and their simulation in coupled climate models. I also apply deep learning and numerical models (e.g., WRF) to improve our understanding of tropical weather systems.
